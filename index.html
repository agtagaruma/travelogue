                                    <p>Baguio City,  frequently known as the "City of Pines" is a densely populated metropolis in the Philippines' northern region. It's known for its chilly temperature,  picturesque landscapes, and different culture. Baguio City also boasts a thriving erudite community that has made important benefactions to Philippine literature. In this travelogue, we will look at the  megacity's  erudite culture and how it reflects the  city's  station toward "art for art's sake" vs "art for social purposes." </p>

Many of the nation's most illustrious authors, including Nick Joaquin and Jose Garcia Villa, have lived there at some point in their lives. The city is also home to numerous literary organizations, festivals, and events that honor the written word. </p>

                                    <h5>Art for Art's Sake</h5>

                                    <p>The "art for art's sake" school of thought has significantly influenced Baguio City's literary landscape. This strategy puts an emphasis on creative expression and originality while putting the work's beauty and aesthetics above social or political considerations. Writers and poets are lauded for their inventive use of language and outlandish writing styles, such as Jose Garcia Villa, who is well-known for his "comma poetry." One of the earliest literary groups in the city that adheres to this idea is the Baguio Writers Group, which was established in 1937. They hold that literature should be valued for its own sake, independent of any social or political significance. This strategy has resulted in a wide and varied spectrum of literature that highlights the brilliance and creativity of the area's artists.</p>

                                    <h5> Art for Social Purposes</h5>

                                    <p>There are writers who prioritize "art for social purposes," which sees art as a tool for social and political change, and many writers in Baguio City use their art to raise awareness of social and political issues. While "art for art's sake" has had a significant impact on the literary scene in Baguio City, there are also writers who prioritize "art for social purposes". They discuss issues like poverty, inequality, and breaches of human rights among others in their literature.</p>

                                    <p>One of the literary groups in the city that places a high priority on social advocacy and participation is the Philippine Writers League, established in 1927. They utilize their position to advocate for social fairness and reform because they think that writing can be a potent agent for change. Their work demonstrates how literature can be used as a tool for advocacy and action in addition to being an expression of aesthetic talent. Overall, these two methods present various viewpoints on the function of literature and how it might influence society.</p>
